  ALEA is a computational toolbox for allele-specific (AS) epigenomics analysis, which incorporates allelic variation data within existing
  resources, allowing for the identification of significant associations between epigenetic modifications and specific allelic variants
  in human and mouse cells. ALEA provides a customizable pipeline of command line tools for AS analysis of next-generation sequencing data
  (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, etc.) that takes the raw sequencing data and produces separate allelic tracks ready to be viewed on genome browsers.
  ALEA takes advantage of the available genomic resources for human (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium) and mouse (The Mouse Genome Project)
  to reconstruct diploid in silico genomes for human samples or hybrid mouse samples under study. Then, for each accompanying ChIP-seq or
  RNA-seq dataset, ALEA generates two wig files from short reads aligned differentially to each haplotype.
  This pipeline has been validated using human and hybrid mouse ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data (See Test Data section).
